# Suggested Data Layout #

For simplicity (and to also make actively maintinaing updating the git repo 
easier) It is suggested that all data be stored in this folder, which is not
actively tracked in the git. Furthermore, it is suggested that users place
specific datasets within seperate sub folder.
